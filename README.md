## Virtual Device Plugins

Example plugins for working with Bonitoo's Virtual Device project.

These plugins rely on the [Virtual Device](https://github.com/bonitoo-io/virtual-device).  To build them (for now) install the Virtual Device project to your local maven repository.  For example in Virtual Device `$ mvn clean install`.
